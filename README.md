# Django REST API CRUD Application

This project is a Django REST API application for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a simple model.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Apply migrations to create the database schema:

    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. Start the Django development server:

    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints:

- List all instances of the model: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/book/` (GET)
- Create a new instance of the model: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/book/` (POST)
- Retrieve a specific instance of the model: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/book/<id>/` (GET)
- Update a specific instance of the model: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/book/<id>/` (PUT, PATCH)
- Delete a specific instance of the model: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/book/<id>/` (DELETE)

Replace `<id>` with the ID of the instance you want to retrieve, update, or delete.

## Extending Further

- Add authentication and authorization to secure your API endpoints.
- Implement additional features such as filtering, pagination, and custom endpoints.
- Optimize database queries for better performance.
- Enhance security by implementing rate limiting, HTTPS, and other security best practices.
